Hacking capitalism for fun and profit

or,

Take control or your life!






=====================================



















Observations
============

* Many people in our community are very talented, but don't get the jobs they
  would like to have.

* Our skills are generally in high demand, which is a big privilege.

* Companies take advantage of people's low confidence to counter the effects of
  high demand. 





















My story
========

* I am infected with wanderlust.

* I have had good jobs, but not enough time to travel.

* I had to surrender privileges like semi-remote work, to advance other goals.

* I ended up in a great job at Google, earning more money than I needed. But zero chances of remote work, or travelling for long periods of time.




















An epiphany
===========

I thought,

There are many companies that need what I do, and there is not enough people to
do it.

They don't necessarily need a person 9-to-5.

They are willing to pay $$.

I can set my conditions, and this might work out.


















Results
=======

I quit my job 2 and a half months ago.

I have already one customer, and some potential ones.

I can work from wherever I am, my plan is to live in different places, 3 months
at a time, and work from there.

I can charge more and therefore, work less hours.

 => Work only when I feel productive, end those endless hours of
    procrastination staring at Wikipedia


You can do it too!

And the more they do it, the more demand, yay!
